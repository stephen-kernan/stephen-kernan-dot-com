## What is a Brag Document?

Simply put, a **brag document** is a living document which tracks the highlights of your career. As little wins stack up, you can add a quick recap of those wins to your brag document to help yourself remember the context and outcomes later. The small habit of keeping an up-to-date brag document can have a huge impact on your career.

A brag document is great for:

- Capturing the amazing work you’re doing 🌟
- Aligning your work to your company’s career ladder 🪜
- Making sure your work is visible when your manager starts your performance review 🔍
- Giving yourself a starting point for building a fantastic resume 📝
- Helping you prep for behavioral interviews 🙌

## Structure of a Brag Document Entry

Here are some of the key pieces of information you’ll want to include in each entry:

- **Context surrounding your action:** When did this happen? Why did you take on this task? What are 2-3 facts I should know about this project in order to understand your actions?
- **Clear explanation of your actions:** It should be very clear from this document exactly what _you_ did and how that action led to the outcome. “Led the project” is probably too vague. Be careful to avoid using “we”. If your team did this, what part of the team’s effort were _you_ in charge of?
- **Specific results:** What was the outcome of your actions? It should be obvious how your actions led to the result. Be sure to include specific metrics wherever possible.

Brag documents are very flexible. Assuming you have the relevant information in each entry, you have a lot of creative freedom to structure entries in a way that makes sense to you. However, It’s important to keep it simple so that you’re more likely to keep it updated. My rule of thumb for brag documents is to keep it simple enough that you can make a new entry in less than one minute.

I prefer to use the [STAR Method](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/the-star-method-for-behavioral-interviews/) to format my recaps because it forces me to include all of the necessary information while giving me a structure to get started. This also has the advantage of giving you a head-start when preparing for interviews, since the STAR Method is now the industry standard for behavioral interviews.

## Getting the most out of a Brag Document.

### 1. Share it with your manager.

Sharing examples from your brag document with your manager has two key advantages:

1. You increase the visibility into your work. Your manager is likely pretty busy and it’s impossible to expect them to remember (or even hear about) all of your accomplishments. The more context they get from you, the more likely it is that they can be a good advocate for you.
2. You increase the amount of time your manager can spend crafting focused feedback. Since your manager isn’t starting from a blank page, they can spend more time reflecting on your work than on remembering it.

This may be a bit controversial but, if you’re comfortable with it, I highly recommend creating a role-specific copy of your brag document and sharing the entire document with your manager directly. This makes the process of sharing your accomplishments a _collaborative_ effort and ensures that they have the context they need _when they need it_. Conversations about promotions and compensation adjustments will likely happen when you’re not in the room, and equipping your manager with the context they need will help them be a good advocate for you.

That said, not everyone will want to share their brag document directly. If you’re uncomfortable with that level of visibility (or if your manager has lost your trust), that’s completely understandable. In that case, try sharing your brag document _indirectly_ by occasionally sharing key updates from your brag document in a 1:1 or through direct messages. That way, you can still ensure that your manager knows about your accomplishments.

### 2. Don’t forget the little things.

Not every accomplishment involves launching a new product. Many important skills for senior-level roles (such as influencing others, removing roadblocks, or mentoring teammates) happen behind-the-scenes and are therefore more difficult to quantify during a performance review. Including specific, high-impact examples of your soft-skills in your brag document will make it much easier to illustrate these skills later.

### 3. Connect it to your career ladder.

Your career ladder is your company’s wishlist of employee traits. By linking your accomplishments to specific areas of your career ladder, you are effectively saying “You told me you want X. I gave you X this quarter, and here’s when/how I did it.”

> Looking for a promotion? Try linking your accomplishments to the career ladder _one level above your current role_. If you can prove that you’ve been performing at the next level for past 3-6 months, you will make the case for your promotion even stronger.

If your company doesn’t have a career ladder that’s visible to employees, try connecting your accomplishments to their _core values_ instead. While core values aren’t as role-specific, they do reflect your company’s ideal employee. They provide a way to link your accomplishment to something the company values.
