# Understanding ORM migrations

An Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework is a language-specific abstraction layer that makes it easier to work with a database in the same language as the rest of the codebase.

One of the key features of an ORM is the ability to create migrations. Migrations are a way to manage changes to the database schema over time. They allow developers to version control their database schema and apply changes in a consistent and repeatable manner.

Because migrations are such a key part of working with a database in a modern application, it’s important to understand how they work. In this article, we’ll take a look at how migrations work in an ORM framework and how to use them effectively.

## What is a migration?

A migration is simply a script that contains a set of instructions for modifying the database schema. Migrations can be used to create new tables, add or remove columns, create indexes, and more.
