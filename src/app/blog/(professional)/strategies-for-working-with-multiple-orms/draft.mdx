# Strategies for working with multiple ORMs

## 1. Use a single ORM to manage migrations on a single database

If you have multiple databases, then it may be reasonable to use a different ORM for each database. 

## 2. Resist the urge to copy all fields from one ORM to another

- It will be a huge waste of time to keep them in sync
- Keeping them in sync is completely unnecessary
- Keeping them in sync may actually cause bugs because removing a field will become significantly more risky
