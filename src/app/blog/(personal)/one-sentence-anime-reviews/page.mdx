# One-sentence anime reviews

<Byline {...metadata} />

As I watch through more anime, I want to keep track of my thoughts on them. Below, I‚Äôll keep a list of one-sentence reviews of the anime I‚Äôve watched.

This list is sorted by rating, then alphabetically by title.

| Anime                | Rating | Review                                                                              |
| :------------------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One Piece**        | üèÜ     | The greatest story ever told                                                        |
| **Erased**           | ü§©     | Super-tense limited series that's also a great watch for non-anime people.          |
| **Vinland Saga**     | ü§©     | Well balanced - super thoughtful and introspective, with CRISP hand-to-hand fights. |
| **Deathnote**        | ‚úÖ     | First half was amazing, second half was just pretty good.                           |
| **My Hero Academia** | ‚úÖ     | A bit clich√®, but good enough to keep watching.                                     |
| **Naruto**           | ‚úÖ     | Iconic, but plenty of filler to skip                                                |
| **Naruto Shippuden** | ‚úÖ     | Some of the most iconic fights / arcs in anime                                      |
| **Fire Force**       | ü§∑     | It would be SO much better if it didn‚Äôt sexualize the women so much                 |
| **Ranking of Kings** | ‚ùå     | It‚Äôs cute, but it‚Äôs not particularly great.                                         |
