# I built a workout plan with ChatGPT's deep research

It’s been about 4 months since I stopped lifting weights. Today, I decided to get back into the gym. I thought it would be nice to switch up my typical routine, but designing a workout program takes a lot of time and effort.

Typically, I would spend a whole day building planning and organizing - which is perfect, because it would let me wait until _tomorrow_ to start working out.

But there’s no guarantee that my motivation would be there tomorrow so, rather than waste a day planning, I decided to use ChatGPT’s deep research feature to build myself a custom workout program.

## Choosing a split

Before I could start building my workout plan, I needed to choose a split. A split is a way of organizing your workouts over the week. You might do a full-body workout every day, or you might do a different muscle group each day.

There are infinite ways to break up your workouts, but you can't design a workout plan until you pick one. I asked ChatGPT to build me a 4-day training split that looks like this:

| Day 1  | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Legs\* | Push  | Pull  | Rest  |

I chose this split for a few reasons:

1. **It’s simple:** Finding the perfectly-optimized split is a waste of time. For the vast majority of people, working out consistently is significantly more important than the way they split up their workouts.
2. **Fewer days off:** I’m the type of person who needs consistency for a habit to stick. Too many days off leads to even more days skipped.
3. **Spread out each muscle group:** Train each muscle group roughly twice per week means I can get more good sets in for each muscle.

\* I started with legs to take advantage of the fact that I'm motivated right now, so I'm less likely to skip.

## Building the plan

Here’s the prompt template I used to build my plan, which breaks down my goals, preferences, and constraints:

```plaintext
I want your help crafting a workout plan.

I want each workout to be no longer than {MAX LENGTH} minutes.

I’d prefer a {LENGTH}-day split ({...LIST OF WORKOUTS}).

My long-term goals are:

- {GOALS}

I’d consider myself a {EXPERIENCE LEVEL}, and I like {TYPES OF WORKOUTS}.

I have access to the following equipment:

- {EQUIPMENT}
```

Before ChatGPT went off to build my plan, it asked me a few follow-up questions, such as preferences about supersets, current pain/limitations, and whether or not to include the warm-up in the 45-minute time window.

I answered the questions and then went for a walk while ChatGPT worked on my plan. About 10 minutes into my walk, my watch notified me that my plan was ready.

## My plan

ChatGPT cooked up a pretty solid plan. They created a 12-week workout plan that includes the exercises, sets, and reps. Along with that, they told me that I should be aiming for a [Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)](/notes/rate-of-perceived-exertion) of 8 for each set.

It created supersets to keep my workouts under 45 minutes, and it even included a few mobility exercises to help with my squat.

### Day 1: Legs

On leg day, I’ll be working on my quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Here’s the breakdown ChatGPT gave me:

| Exercise                | Sets | Reps  |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Squats                  | 4    | 4-6   |
| Romanian Deadlifts      | 3    | 6-8   |
| Bulgarian Split Squat\* | 3    | 8-10  |
| Calf Raises\*           | 3    | 12-15 |
| Goblet Squat\*\*        | 3    | 10-12 |
| Glute Bridges\*\*       | 3    | 10-12 |

_\* Indicates first superset pair_

_\*\* Indicates second superset pair_

### Day 2: Push

On push day, I’ll be working on my chest, shoulders, and triceps. Here’s the breakdown ChatGPT gave me:

| Exercise             | Sets | Reps  |
| -------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Bench Press          | 4    | 6-8   |
| Overhead Press       | 4    | 6-8   |
| Incline Bench\*      | 3    | 8-10  |
| Banded Pull-Aparts\* | 3    | 12-15 |
| Lateral Raises\*\*   | 3    | 12-15 |
| Skull Crushers\*\*   | 3    | 8-10  |

_\* Indicates first superset pair_

_\*\* Indicates second superset pair_

### Day 3: Pull

On pull day, I’ll be working on my back, biceps, and hamstrings. Here’s the breakdown ChatGPT gave me:

| Exercise                     | Sets | Reps  |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Pull-ups                     | 3    | AMRAP |
| Barbell Rows                 | 3    | 6-8   |
| Face Pulls\*                 | 3    | 12-15 |
| Hammer Curls\*               | 3    | 10-12 |
| Single-arm Dumbbell Rows\*\* | 3    | 8-10  |
| Barbell Curls\*\*            | 3    | 8-10  |

_\* Indicates first superset pair_

_\*\* Indicates second superset pair_
