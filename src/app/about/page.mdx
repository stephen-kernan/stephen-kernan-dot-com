## About me

I've been working as a software engineer since 2020, when a fantastic group of folks gave me a chance after three years teaching myself to code.

I'm currently working as a tech lead at Axios, where I run the Research, Automation, and Development team. I'm lucky enough to work with a team that trusts each other completely and who stretches my imagination.

## Current fixation

I recently got a Kodak H35N camera, which is a film camera with the aesthetics of a disposable camera.

Now, I'm obsessed with getting back a roll of developed film from the store because it adds such a feeling of nostalgia to my recent memories with my friends and family. All of the photos on the right are from this film.

## My favorite media

- One Piece
- Conclave
- _Small Things Like These_ by Claire Keegan
- Tunic (PS5)
