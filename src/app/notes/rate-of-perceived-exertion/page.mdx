# RPE

RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) is a supjective scale used to measure the intensity of exercise. <sup>1</sup> It ranges from 1 to 10, where 1 is very light activity and 10 is maximal effort.

For example, an RPE of 8 means the person is working hard but could still perform 1-2 more reps before reaching failure.

There's an excellent breakdown of RPE by Jeff Nippard [here](https://youtu.be/deDlhPmT2SY?si=_i66cFM0nOS_RBNz) <sup>2</sup>.
