# Two-way doors

[Two-way doors](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html) are a simple framework for making decisions that are easy to reverse. This idea was popularized by Jeff Bezos at Amazon.

The idea is that some decisions are like one-way doors: once you go through them, you can't go back without significant effort (if at all). Other decisions are like two-way doors: you can go through them, but you can also go back if you need to.
